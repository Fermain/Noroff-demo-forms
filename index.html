          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            Forms provide developers with a standardised interface used to
            accept user input. This is the only valid way in HTML to collect
            user input - as the majority of other HTML tags are read-only.
          </p>
          <p>
            In any situation where user input is required, a form should be
            used. This includes a searchbar, blog comments, sending a message in
            a chat app, or even controlling an online video game.
          </p>
          <p>
            All form elements that accept user input, including Input and
            Textarea tags, should be wrapped inside a form element.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section id="validation">
          <h2>Validation</h2>
          <p>
            Validation is a process that analyses the input provided by the user
            and tests this against a list of provided requirements. If the input
            does not satisfy the requirements, it is called invalid.
          </p>
          <aside>
            <b>Example</b>
            <p>
              A simple example would be an email address input field. Here we
              expect the user to input a series of characters including an @
              symbol and at least one full stop symbol (name@domain.com).
            </p>
            <p>
              Allowing a user to ignore these rules could mean that they are
              locked out of a newly created online account.
            </p>
            <p>
              By validating the provided address, we can make sure that it is at
              least shaped in the right way before sending the form.
            </p>
          </aside>
          <p>
            Often developers will go to great lengths in order to validate their
            forms using complex javascript, but this is not always necessary.
            The purpose of this tutorial is to show the easiest, most robust and
            reliable methods for validating forms.
          </p>

          <h3 id="client-side">Client Side Validation</h3>
          <p>
            It is common to separate validation into two subjects: Client Side
            and Server Side.
          </p>
          <aside>
            <p>
              This tutorial will only deal with Client Side validation as this
              is the process that happens within the browser before the data is
              sent anywhere.
            </p>
            <p>
              Server Side validation is more commonly handled by backend or full
              stack developers. Client Side validation is almost always done by
              Front End Developers
            </p>
          </aside>
          <p>
            Client Side validation is primarily meant to improve the user
            experience, unlike Server Side validation which is primarily used
            for security. The purpose of client validation is to show the user
            where they have made errors and to guide them towards correcting
            this.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is important to note that Client Side validation can easily be
            disabled by a technical user (you), for this reason it cannot be
            relied upon as a security measure. Without both forms of validation
            an application that accepts user data cannot be fully secured.
          </p>

          <h3 id="server-side">Server Side Validation</h3>
          <p>
            When sending data to a web server to be stored or processed this
            request must be examined before it can be accepted by the server.
          </p>
          <p>
            If the provided data is dangerous, or improperly formatted, the
            server will return an error response with the code 400 (Bad
            Request).
          </p>
          <p>
            Sometimes, the client side and server side validation will disagree.
            In these cases the server response must be respected as this is the
            "Source of Truth" in this situation.
          </p>
          <p>
            An example of a dangerous input that a server should reject would be
            a string of text designed to corrupt a database. This is called an
            SQL injection attack.
