          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            Forms provide developers with a standardised interface used to
            accept user input. This is the only valid way in HTML to collect
            user input - as the majority of other HTML tags are read-only.
          </p>
          <p>
            In any situation where user input is required, a form should be
            used. This includes a searchbar, blog comments, sending a message in
            a chat app, or even controlling an online video game.
          </p>
          <p>
            All form elements that accept user input, including Input and
            Textarea tags, should be wrapped inside a form element.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section id="validation">
          <h2>Validation</h2>
          <p>
            Validation is a process that analyses the input provided by the user
            and tests this against a list of provided requirements. If the input
            does not satisfy the requirements, it is called invalid.
          </p>
          <aside>
            <b>Example</b>
            <p>
              A simple example would be an email address input field. Here we
              expect the user to input a series of characters including an @
              symbol and at least one full stop symbol (name@domain.com).
            </p>
            <p>
              Allowing a user to ignore these rules could mean that they are
              locked out of a newly created online account.
            </p>
            <p>
              By validating the provided address, we can make sure that it is at
              least shaped in the right way before sending the form.
            </p>
          </aside>
          <p>
            Often developers will go to great lengths in order to validate their
            forms using complex javascript, but this is not always necessary.
            The purpose of this tutorial is to show the easiest, most robust and
            reliable methods for validating forms.
          </p>

          <h3 id="client-side">Client Side Validation</h3>
          <p>
            It is common to separate validation into two subjects: Client Side
            and Server Side.
          </p>
          <aside>
            <p>
              This tutorial will only deal with Client Side validation as this
              is the process that happens within the browser before the data is
              sent anywhere.
            </p>
            <p>
              Server Side validation is more commonly handled by backend or full
              stack developers. Client Side validation is almost always done by
              Front End Developers
            </p>
          </aside>
          <p>
            Client Side validation is primarily meant to improve the user
            experience, unlike Server Side validation which is primarily used
            for security. The purpose of client validation is to show the user
            where they have made errors and to guide them towards correcting
            this.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is important to note that Client Side validation can easily be
            disabled by a technical user (you), for this reason it cannot be
            relied upon as a security measure. Without both forms of validation
            an application that accepts user data cannot be fully secured.
          </p>

          <h3 id="server-side">Server Side Validation</h3>
          <p>
            When sending data to a web server to be stored or processed this
            request must be examined before it can be accepted by the server.
          </p>
          <p>
            If the provided data is dangerous, or improperly formatted, the
            server will return an error response with the code 400 (Bad
            Request).
          </p>
          <p>
            Sometimes, the client side and server side validation will disagree.
            In these cases the server response must be respected as this is the
            "Source of Truth" in this situation.
          </p>
          <p>
            An example of a dangerous input that a server should reject would be
            a string of text designed to corrupt a database. This is called an
            SQL injection attack.
          </p>

          <h3>HTML Validation</h3>
          <p>
            HTML5 introduced a powerful set of attributes that allow for
            validation of form input elements without the need for complicated
            javascript.
          </p>
          <p>
            Using HTML validation is not simply about saving time writing code,
            it also provides a highly accessible platform that can be used by
            differently abled users. For example, the custom error message
            created to alert a user that their email is in the wrong format
            cannot reasonably be translated into every language. However the
            error messages provided by HTML validation will use the Browser's
            default language!
          </p>
          <p>
            Since all of the validation happens in HTML, we can access the state
            of the input via CSS by using <code>input:valid {}</code> or
            <code>input:invalid {}</code>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Try the search example below. This has been setup with the most
            simple form of validation - the user must provide a minimum of one
            character of any kind.
          </p>
          <form id="search-dummy">
            <fieldset>
              <legend>Search Example</legend>
              <div class="form-group">
                <input
                  type="text"
                  name="term"
                  class="form-control"
                  id="exampleSearchInput1"
                  required
                  placeholder="Search"
                />
              </div>
              <div class="form-group">
                <button class="btn btn-primary">Search</button>
              </div>
            </fieldset>
          </form>
          <p>
            This form will not do anything when it is submitted, because it has
            no <code>action</code> attribute.
          </p>
          <p>
            If we add
            <code>action="/examples/search.html" method="GET"</code> to the
            <code>form</code> tag, it will redirect to this URL along with our
            search values:
          </p>
          <form id="search" action="/examples/search.html" method="GET">
            <fieldset>
              <legend>Working Search Example</legend>
              <div class="form-group">
                <input
                  type="text"
                  name="term"
                  class="form-control"
                  id="exampleSearchInput1"
                  required
                  placeholder="Search"
                />
              </div>
              <div class="form-group">
                <button class="btn btn-primary">Search</button>
              </div>
            </fieldset>
          </form>
          <aside>
            <p>
              The javascript behaviour needed to utilise this on the destination
              page will be examined <a href="#form-responses">here</a>.
            </p>
          </aside>
          <p>
            We can introduce much more sophisticated behaviour than this using
            HTML validation, however. Some input cases are very common, and have
            predictable formats that can be handled with specialised attributes.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, an email address has a standard format that is easy to
            predict. It is also a very common input to collect from a user, so
            we have a special input type that will automatically validate input:
          </p>
          <form id="email">
            <fieldset>
              <legend>Email Validation Example</legend>
              <div class="form-group">
                <label for="exampleInputEmail1">Your email address</label>
                <input type="email" class="form-control" id="exampleInputEmail1"  placeholder="name@example.com" required>
              </div>
              <div class="form-group">
                <button class="btn btn-primary">Submit</button>
              </div>
            </fieldset>
          </form>
        </section>
        <section id="form-responses"></section>
      </div>
    </main>
  </body>
</html>
